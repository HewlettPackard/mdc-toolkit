## Introduction

Hewlett Packard Labs has developed tools that enable
programmers to realize the full benefits of
[Memory Driven Computing](https://www.labs.hpe.com/next-next/mdc) (MDC) and persistent memory.  Current
HPE Superdome X machines feature massive, multi-terabyte memories and hundreds of
processor cores, and current [HPE servers feature persistent
memory](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers/persistent-memory.html)
implemented with NVDIMMs; future persistent memory products may employ
non-volatile memory (NVM) device technologies such as Memristor.
Fabric-attached memory (FAM) promises to scale far beyond today's
cache-coherent shared memory while preserving the convenience of
byte-addressable memory.

This repository provides a unified entry point to several Hewlett
Packard Labs tools and technologies related to MDC and persistent memory. 
We welcome comments and feedback. For help and support issues, please contact daniel.feldman@hpe.com.
